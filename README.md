# Policy-DrivenImmigrationAnalysis
 This is a comprehensive analysis of the flow of Lawful Permanent Residents into the United States annually and how their settlement patterns have changed over the years into the Core Based Stastistical Areas. 
 
 ## Objective 
 The purpose of this is to identify the numbers of population who have received Lawful Permanent Residents each four-years (respresenting Presidential terms) and the region they come from in comparison; to identify the top 20 countries where the number of Lawful Permanent Residents come from; and to analyze their settlement patterns particularly in Core Based Stastistical Areas (Metro Areas) and examine if they have changed during each Presidential Period (from 2009 through 2020 - approximately three presidential terms).
